Our best tagger explores and includes useful knowledge sources for tagging Vietnamese text and gives a 93.40\%overall accuracy and a 80.69\%unknown word accuracy on a test set of the Vietnamese treebank. Our tagger significantly outperforms the tagger that is being used for building the Vietnamese treebank, and as far as we are aware, this is the best tagging result ever published for the Vietnamese language.}},

  Abstract                 = {When banks process their free-form telex traffic, the
 first task is the classification of the telexes.
 Historically, several attempts have been made to automate
 this process, using various stock phrases as the features
 on which to base the classification. This is a problem in
 which there are large amounts of data available, but the
 rules for classification are not explicitly available. For
 solving these kinds of problems, neural networks have the
 advantage of extracting the underlying relationships
 between the input data and the output classes
 automatically. Based on this consideration, the authors
 have built a neural network classification system, which
 has three subsystems: a user-maintainable feature
 definition subsystem, a feature extraction subsystem, and
 a neural network subsystem. The neural network is
 simulated on a VAX computer with a fast learning
 algorithm, and is combined with some non-statistical
 knowledge from the feature definition system. Above 90\%
 correct recognition rates have been achieved for the major
 categories concerned. The system is also applicable to
 text classification problems other than telex
 classification.}
